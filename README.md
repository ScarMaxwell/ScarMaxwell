# Hi, I'm Scar!

💻 I'm a Management Information Systems student at [Wichita State University](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scarmaxwell), focused on specializing in cybersecurity.

I’m passionate about security architecture, hands-on systems work, and building tools that solve real problems. I’m currently sharpening my skills through certs like Network+, Security+, and CCNA, while working on personal projects and applied learning in the field.

🛠️ Tools I’m learning: Python, PowerShell, Bash, Cisco, and more.
📚 Always curious. Always building.
